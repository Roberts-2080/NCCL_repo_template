## Description

<b>Model</b>: resnet50 <br>
<b>Dataset</b>: TinyImagenet <br>
<b>Communication Backend</b>: NCCL <br>
<b>Package used</b>: PyTorch

## Running or Launching the project

You can run the Dockerfile using this command
```
sudo docker run --rm --gpus all --network host \
    --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    -it -v $(pwd):/workspace nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.07-py3
```
or simply run
```
./launch_docker.sh
```

If "launch_docker.sh" cannot run, you might need to give permission to execute the file.
```
chmod +x launch_docker.sh
```

Dockerfile will install Nvidia PyTorch Image and install python3 and all the required software in `requirements.txt`.

Afterwards, you will be running our program in a container
```
python3 res50.py -b {batch_size} -e {epoch_size} -g {no_of_gpus} -lr {learning_rate}
```

Once the training has been completed, you can use Tensorboard to detect the model's performance
Write this command in the terminal
```
tensorboard --logdir=./log
```
Once the tensorboard has finished loading (it will look like it is stuck), use your desired web browser and go to this link
```
http://localhost:6006/
```
It will launch an interactive html of Tensorboard.

To install PyTorch's profiling tool
```
pip3 install torch_tb_profiler
```

Note: We use Tensorboard as our profiling tool and is not installed by Docker upon launch.


## Structure or Descriptions of our Files

- `res50.py`: this file contains code for training on the datasets, TinyImageNet, using the model "resnet50" by using NCCL as the preferred communication backend across GPU.
- `RestructureValData.py`: this file restructure the initial structure of the TinyImageNet from the internet to suit our needs.
- `SetupTinyImagenet.sh`: downloads the dataset, TinyImageNet
